/// Search Scheduled Notifications
/// This endpoint searches on Scheduled Notifications. If a scheduled notification was created with the visibility parameter set to PUBLIC, then anyone can search on it if the filter parameter includes the PUBLIC value. PRIVATE visibility means that it can only be searched on by the owner or if it has been shared to the user using the UserPermissionsApi.  In addition, if a PUBLIC Scheduled Notification was created for an application that requires content approval (using the publicContentApproval parameter), then an administrator of the application needs to approve it before it can be search on by other users. Before this happens, it is in a PENDING state, and only the original creator or the owner of the application can search and see it. Also, only the owner of the application can use the UserPermissionsApi to approve or reject it. Scheduled notifications that have been rejected are only visible to the original creators.
