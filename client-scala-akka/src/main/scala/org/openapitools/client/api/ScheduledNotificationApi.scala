   * 
   * @param accountId The logged in user.
   * @param name The name of the scheduled notification
   * @param `type` The type of scheduled notification. Supported values include: MOBILE_NOTIFICATION - sends push notifications via APNS and GCM EMAIL - sends email messages SMS - sends text messages
   * @param message The message to send
   * @param contentId The payload content ID that gets sent along with the message. For push notification, this could be used in client apps to know what the message is referring to and open up the related view.
   * @param contentName The payload content name that gets sent along with the message. For push notification, this could be used in client apps to know what the message is referring to and open up the related view.
   * @param contentType The payload content type that gets sent along with the message. For push notification, this could be used in client apps to know what the message is referring to and open up the related view.

   * @param parentType The payload parent type that gets sent along with the message. For push notification, this could be used in client apps to know what the message is referring to and open up the related view.
   * @param appKey The application that the notifications will send to. If connectionGroupIds, connectionAccountIds, and audienceIds is not set, this will send to all users who have used the application. This parameter is also required when sending push notifications via the MOBILE_NOTIFICATION type.
   * @param groupingId Client defined identifier for grouping multiple scheduled notifications. This can be used with the search endpoint to return scheduled notifications with the same groupingId for display purposes. Only results that have been created by the user will be returned when using this feature.

   * @param endpointURL The URL for making an HTTP call
   * @param payload The parameters for making an HTTP call
   * @param scheduledDate The next time when the scheduled notification should begin processing (time in milliseconds). If this is left empty, then the startDate will be used.
   * @param startDate The start time when the scheduled notification should be available to process (time in milliseconds). If this is left empty, then it will be assumed to be available now.
   * @param endDate The end time when the scheduled notification should be available to process (time in milliseconds). If this is left empty, then it will be assumed to not have an expiration date.
   * @param cronExpression The cron expression that represents the processing schedule. This uses the unix cron expression format. For example: 0 0 * * * will run once a day at midnight UTC.
   * @param cronType The cron expression type: UNIX, CRON4J, QUARTZ
   * @param metaData Additional metadata for the scheduled notification
   * @param conditionalInput Json input representing conditional logic that has to be met before running the scheduled notification
   * @param templateType This determines if the Scheduled Notification is a template which is used as a basis for dynamically generating re-occurring Scheduled Notifications. The available types include: REPORTING - saves an adhoc report to be able to run again at another time GEOFENCE_OWNER - template for sending notifications to the geofence/audience owner (i.e. the business owner) GEOFENCE_OWNER - template for sending notifications to the geofence/audience owner (i.e. the business employee, retailer location, etc) GEOFENCE_TRIGGER - template for sending notifications to the account that triggered the geofence/audience (i.e. the customer) GEOFENCE_HTTP_CALL - template for making http calls when the geofences are triggered
   * @param visibility Determines the scope of who is able to find and view the scheduled notification (PUBLIC - openly available to all Sirqul users, PRIVATE - only available to users that have been invited)

In addition, if a PUBLIC Scheduled Notification was created for an application that requires content approval (using the publicContentApproval parameter), then an administrator of the application needs to approve it before it can be search on by other users. Before this happens, it is in a PENDING state, and only the original creator or the owner of the application can search and see it. Also, only the owner of the application can use the UserPermissionsApi to approve or reject it. Scheduled notifications that have been rejected are only visible to the original creators.
